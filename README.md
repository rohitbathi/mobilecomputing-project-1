#### Imagine you are new to the programming world and not proficient enough in coding. But, you have a brilliant idea where you want to develop a context-sensing application like Project 1. You come across the Heath-Dev paper and want it to build your application. Specify what Specifications you should provide to the Health-Dev framework to develop the code ideally.

For the context-sensing application, I would specify the infrared heart rate sensor and respiration sensor, specifying their type and sample frequency. I would use methods such as PeakDetect for heart rate calculation. If I were using a camera, I would provide the resolution and picture processing methods. Communication will be via Bluetooth, and the network design will include a routing protocol as well as energy management features such as duty cycling. The user interface will have buttons to start and stop data collecting, as well as display elements for heart rate and respiration rate.

#### In Project 1 you have stored the userâ€™s symptoms data in the local server. Using the bHealthy application suite how can you provide feedback to the user and develop a novel application to improve context sensing and use that to generate the model of the user?

Using the bHealthy app suite, I can combine the user's symptom information with real-time physiological data from ECG and EEG devices. The app's assessment features will use this information to identify the user's emotional state, such as stress or relaxation. Based on the findings, training apps like BrainHealth can recommend activities such as relaxation techniques or physical workouts. I may create a new app that combines this real-time input with previously recorded symptom data to deliver more personalized recommendations. For example, if the user reports regular headaches and the sensors identify excessive stress, the app may suggest both mental relaxation and physical activity. Over time, the app will build a health model by continuously tracking both symptom and sensor data, making future predictions and providing personalized health recommendations. This approach improves context sensing and helps create more effective, customized feedback for the user.

#### A common assumption is mobile computing is mostly about app development. After completing Project 1 and reading both papers, have your views changed? If yes, what do you think mobile computing is about and why? If no, please explain why you still think mobile computing is mostly about app development, providing examples to support your viewpoint

After working on Project 1, I assumed mobile computing was primarily about app development. In the project, I created a context-aware Android app that monitors heart rate and breathing rate using sensors and stores data locally. However, reading the bHealthy and Health-Dev articles shifted my perspective. Mobile computing entails more than just app development; it also incorporates real-time data, sensor feedback, and adaptive systems. For example, bHealthy leverages physiological feedback to make individualized recommendations, whereas Health-Dev automates code creation for sensor networks, dealing with complexity such as communication protocols and energy management. These examples demonstrate that mobile computing is about building an ecosystem of interconnected systems, rather than just the apps themselves. It is about real-time communication and data-driven decision-making.
